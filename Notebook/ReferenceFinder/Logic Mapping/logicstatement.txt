There are two .csv a.csv and b.csv.
the script will first ask how many quote IDs max value is 999,for this example we will assume 050 is the input, that is both a.csv and b.csv have quote IDs till 050

both a.csv and b.csv are the same and look like below, line 2 is the example line 1 is the format. in line 1 starting from Quote ID as column 1 and so on i want a script that is accoridng to as defined in logic 1

line 1:Quote ID,Date,Supplier,Product,Electronic Component 1 Name,Electronic Component 1 Cost,Mechanical Component 1 Name,Mechanical Component 1 Cost,Raw Material 1 Name,Raw Material 1 Cost,Conversion Cost 1 Type,Conversion Cost 1 Detail,Conversion Cost 1 Cost,Logistic Choice,Estimated Delivery Cost,Total Cost per Unit,Quantity,Total Project Cost,Electronic Component 2 Name,Electronic Component 2 Cost,Electronic Component 3 Name,Electronic Component 3 Cost,Mechanical Component 2 Name,Mechanical Component 2 Cost,Mechanical Component 3 Name,Mechanical Component 3 Cost,Raw Material 2 Name,Raw Material 2 Cost,Conversion Cost 2 Type,Conversion Cost 2 Detail,Conversion Cost 2 Cost,Conversion Cost 3 Type,Conversion Cost 3 Detail,Conversion Cost 3 Cost,Quality Control 1 Type,Quality Control 1 Detail,Quality Control 1 Cost,Quality Control 2 Type,Quality Control 2 Detail,Quality Control 2 Cost
line2:001,10th February 2071,AutoElectrix,TPS-100,Potentiometer,0.75,Injection-Molded Plastic Casing,0.55,ABS Plastic,0.4,Labor,Assembly Labor,0.6,Air,0.5,6.2,1000,6200,Microcontroller,1.5,Voltage Regulator,0.25,Brass Contact Pins,0.3,Mounting Clamp,0.35,Steel,0.25,Labor,Testing and Calibration,0.35,Labor,Packaging Labor,0.25,Quality Control,Inspection,0.15,Quality Control,Testing Equipment Depreciation,0.1

first at 001, the script will inititate THE below logic for the comparisons the script will refer to b.csv .

I want the output to be in a .csv the column structure of the output .csv is as follows

CQID,CPID,CComp,LCost,DQID,DPID
what value registers under what column in the .csv will be outlined in the logic below

logic1:
1.it will first record the [CQID] this is the quote ID python is starting to analyse with this is in column 0 of the target .csv, then it will look up column 1 and note down the text value which is the corresponding [CPID]

2.it will now take the value under column 4 of a.csv and find exact matches in b.csv for the matches it will compare with numerical value in column 5 of b.csv, for the match where the numerical value
in  column 5 is the lowest, it will note down the [LCost] which is value at column 5,[DQID] which is the value at column 0 of the same row where match was found and [DPID] which is the value at 
column 3 of the same row where the match was found.

3.Start a new row in the output.csv then, take the value under column 18 of a.csv and find exact matches in b.csv for the matches it will compare with numerical value in column 19 of b.csv, for the match where the numerical value
in  column 19 is the lowest, it will note down the [LCost] which is value at column 19,[DQID] which is the value at column 0 of the same row where match was found and [DPID] which is the value at 
column 3 of the same row where the match was found.

4.Start a new row in the output.csv then, take the value under column 20 of a.csv and find exact matches in b.csv for the matches it will compare with numerical value in column 21 of b.csv, for the match where the numerical value
in  column 19 is the lowest, it will note down the [LCost] which is value at column 21,[DQID] which is the value at column 0 of the same row where match was found and [DPID] which is the value at 
column 3 of the same row where the match was found.

remember you need to write me a python script that does this, previously you used a python script that had similar logic but a different output, however the core approach does not seem to change between this previous working script and
the new one you would be making
