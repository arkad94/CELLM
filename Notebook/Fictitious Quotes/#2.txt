Differences from the original quote:

1. **Supplier and Product:** The quote is from a different supplier, HighTechAutoComponents, and the product is an upgraded model, TPS-X500.
2. **Electronic Components:** Replaced the potentiometer with a Hall Effect sensor and upgraded the microcontroller to a 32-bit IoT-enabled version, along with a high-precision voltage regulator.
3. **Mechanical Parts and Raw Materials:** Switched to high-performance materials, using carbon fiber for the casing and titanium for the contact pins, and included a magnetic mounting system.
4. **Conversion Costs:** Increased due to the use of more advanced assembly, testing (IoT-enabled), and AI-driven inspection processes.
5. **Total Costs Calculation:** Both BOM and conversion costs are higher, reflecting the use of advanced materials and technology.
6. **Tooling Cost:** The tooling cost is higher due to the complexity of working with carbon fiber and titanium.
7. **Quote Summary:** The unit price and total order cost are higher, and the payment terms are slightly altered. The delivery time is also extended due to the complexity of the components and assembly process.
